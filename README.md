## About

p3pch4t - Anonymous P2P chat app with focus on being user-friendly.

We have plenty of user-friendly messengers, and we have plenty of p2p messengers, yet it is hard to find on-fit-all solution. And that solution ~~is~~ will be P3pch4t.

Currently p3pch4t is supported on Windows, Linux and Android, with minimal effort MacOS and iOS builds can be done. Main focus is towards compatibility on Linux and Android at this stage. Developer preview builds can be downloaded from [static.mrcyjanek.net](https://static.mrcyjanek.net/p3pch4t/) or [i2p mirror](http://n6hg3o7vh25bftxxqnspfp7li2rh4wkhbqsd65e5sow7hr4gulrq.b32.i2p/p3pch4t).
